PythonChallenge
===============

http://www.pythonchallenge.com/

This is the first Github Repository for the group.

The idea is to group the Python Challenge problems into functions.
Each of us can fork the repo, work on a function, and then commit
changes to the main .py file.

Whenever someone notices a more efficient or elegant way of completing
a challenge, feel free to change the function or add a comment.

I believe rarehunter has already completed the first eleven challenges.
Perhaps he can take the lead and post eleven functions.
